                <h3>Where it all began</h3>
                <p align="justify">
                  New GX Enviro is a black owned, managed and controlled waste management and renewable energy company that was
                  founded in 2011 by two high school friends, Khudusela (‘Khudu’) Pitje (42) and Masopha Moshoeshoe (40). Khudu, the founder
                  and Group CEO of New GX Capital Holdings, a leading black, family owned, investment company, saw the potential for a black
                  owned, managed and controlled waste management company servicing the public sector with corporate levels of
                  professionalism and the entrepreneurial flair to rapidly respond to its client’s needs. Khudu brought Masopha on board to help
                  develop and operationalise the concept which in April 2011 existed as only a spreadsheet. New GX Enviro’s initial focus was the
                  City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality (‘CTMM’) as both Khudu and Masopha have roots there. Khudu’s family home is in
                  the township of Soshanguve and his late father, H.M. Pitje was the former Mayor of Mamelodi. Masopha spent his pre-school
                  years in the informal settlement of Ramogodi in Ga Rankuwa.</p>

                </div>
                <p align="justify">In November 2016, Mpact Operations (http://www.mpact.com/) bought a 12% stake in New GX Enviro. The remaining 88% is
                  held by New GX Capital Holdings. New GX Enviro holds a 100% stake in Nobomate, 100% stake in New GX Alternative Energy
                  and a 32% stake in Shangoni Management Services (http://www.shangoni.co.za/).</p>
                <h3>The wonder years</h3>
                <p align="justify">
                  New GX Enviro leveraged off of the business acumen of its founders, the New GX Capital Holdings balance sheet and an
                  innovative, out of the box approach to waste management to be appointed by the CTMM as a Development Contractor in
                  August 2011 with operations beginning on the 1 st of February 2012. As the Development Contractor for the townships of
                  Atteridgeville, Lotus Gardens and Olievenhoutbosch and their approximately 90,000 households, New GX Enviro was
                  responsible for delivering for delivering the following services to the CTMM through SMMEs selected from its service area and
                  incubated and developed into stand-alone waste management entities:</p>
                <li>Household waste collection </li>
                <li>Litter picking </li>
                <li>Illegal dumping clearance</li>
                <li>Bulk container removal </li>
                <li>Recycling services</li>
                  <p>
                    New GX Enviro sourced all of its operational workers from its service areas and created over 130 new, full time jobs. During the
                  three year incubation, the SMMEs received formal training on all the aspects of entrepreneurship through New GX’s NQF level
                  4 registered course on New Venture Creation; exposure to the operations; and mentoring by New GX Enviro. At the end of the
                  three-year contract period, the SMMEs took over ownership of the waste compactors, which were new at the beginning of the
                  contract period, at zero cost.</p>

                <p align="justify">
                  The model of SMME incubation and capacitation with an asset, has been attempted in different parts of the country with limited
                  success. New GX Enviro was able to buck the trend by understanding that waste collection is primarily a logistics function and
                  efficient and effective operations are key to success and sustainability. So rather than under-capacitating on equipment to
                  generate a upfront CAPEX saving, New GX Enviro bought 21 cubic metre, rear end loader compactor trucks with mechanical
                  low bin lifters for its operations as these and their smaller 19 cubic metre counterparts are the mainstay of metropolitan,
                  municipal waste collection in South Africa. They offer significant operational efficiencies and improved the probability of the
                  future sustainability of the SMMEs beyond the contract period, as there is an established sub-contracting market by
                  municipalities and the private sector for 19 and 21 cubic metre compactor trucks. On the 1 st of February 2015, New GX Enviro
                  passed ownership of six waste compactor trucks to its SMMEs and engaged them as subcontractors for 2 years with a
                  guaranteed annual turnover value of over R10 million based on performance. During the first six months of the subcontracting
                  relationship, New GX Enviro continued to provide financial support to the SMMEs by extending its credit facilities with suppliers
                  to the SMMEs and providing them with preferential payment terms while they built their financial portfolio and reserves. From
                  the 1 st of February 2017, these six SMMEs began providing services directly to the CTMM and employed approximately 70 full
                  time staff from the local community.
